######
	Monte Carlo Ray Tracing code. This code  operates in 2 dimensions and there
	is no reflection of rays from the surfaces.

	Two parallel plates each 1 meter in width with connected midlines
	are spaced 1 meter apart. Calculated the number of rays intercepted by the top surface for a bottom
	surface that is emitting 100,000 rays. 

	Generated plot showing the view
	factor of the top plate as viewed by the bottom plate as a function of distance between the plates. Plot
	the view factor from a distance of 0.5 meters to a distance of 5 meters every 0.5 meters.
	Calculations for 1,000 and 10,000 and 100,000 rays emitted from the bottom plate.
