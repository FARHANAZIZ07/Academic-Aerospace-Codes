		A code  to predict the temperature distribution
		in a 1D plane wall using Gauss Seidel Iteration. The code  to predict the temperature profile in a wall
		is 1 meter wide and has a thermal conductivity of 5 w / m K. The wall has a constant heat flux of 100 W /m2
		going into the left wall and a constant temperature of 300 K on the right wall. 

		A plot of T vs x for 50 nodes with three lines. One line is T vs x curve for a convergence
		criteria of 0.1, another line is the T vs x curve for a convergence criteria of 0.001 and the
		last line is the T vs x curve for a convergence criteria of 0.00001

Second part ofthe code
			Code  to predict the temperature distribution
			in a 1D plane wall using matrix inversion or TDMA. The code to predict the temperature profile in a
			wall is 1 meter wide and has a thermal conductivity of 5 w / m K. The wall has a convection boundary
			condition on the left wall with h = 10 W / m2 K and Tinfinity = 400 K and a constant temperature of 300 K
			on the right wall. 
			 A plot of T vs x with three lines. One line for a solution using 5 nodes, another line for a solution
			using 10 nodes and a final line  using 100 nodes.
