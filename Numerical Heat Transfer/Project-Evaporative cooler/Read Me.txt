	A small evaporative cooler (measuring 12 cm x 12 cm x 2 cm) is fed water from a tank holding a certain
	quantity of water at an initial temperature. At the same moment, the pump moving water to the top of
	the evaporative cooler and a fan blowing air over the evaporative cooler are started at the same time.
	Every one minute, the temperature of the water tank and the temperature of the air leaving the
	evaporative cooler are recorded. The air entered the evaporative cooler at ambient temperature and
	ambient relative humidity. The air travels through small channels within the evaporative cooler
	(approximately 3 mm wide), during which time water is evaporated. The water evaporation cools both
	the water and the air. The water falls back into the bulk tank, cooling the tank water slightly.
Air velocity: 0.5 m/s
Water mass flow rate: 0.02 kg/s
IMPORTANT: The energy to evaporate the water comes from both the water and the air. Assuming some
fraction of the latent energy (call it X) is derived from the water and the other fraction from the air. Assuming a value of 0.5 for X.

	 Code  predict and create a 2D plot showing the transient temperature distribution of
	the air for any time step in the cross-section shown in the Figure above (measuring 2 cm x 3 mm). Using
	200 nodes in the x direction and 50 nodes in the y direction assuming that the air adopts a
	fully developed velocity profile in the channel direction throughout the channels. Simultaneously,
	calculating the change in the bulk temperature of the water as a function of time and using change in bulk
	water temperature for the temperature boundary condition of the walls of the channel.

	Plots of the temperature distribution of the 2D wall at 1 minute, 5 minutes and 10 minutes for 
	optimal value of X.
